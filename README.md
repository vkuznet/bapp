Simple batch application (bapp) written in Erlang. The purpose of this
application is to demonstrate Erlang strength in building distributed
and concurrent applications. The bapp package provides OTP Erlang 
batch server and erlang/python clients. The batch server executes given
command either on a server node or on a set of participating nodes.
The batch server can be configured as VM with multiple CPUs.

The bapp application was originally designed to run a given command
with a given directory, e.g. ls <path>
You may modify this behavior as you please, see
apps/bapp/src/bapp_server.erl, apps/bapp/src/worker.erl.

Dependencies:
-------------

For node autodiscovery on a LAN we depends on nodefinder package, see
http://code.google.com/p/nodefinder/
Based on its license (New BSD license, http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)
its code distribution is allowed to be included with proper COPYING message.

To run the server and erlang client you just need Erlang to be installed
on your system. While python client depends on pyerl (python-erlang binding),
see
https://github.com/hamano/python-erlang-interface.git
git clone git://github.com/hamano/python-erlang-interface.git

Installation:
-------------

1. Untar bapp.tar.gz
2. run make
3. tune-up rel/mynode/etc/vm.args (if required)
4. start-up server as (using bash shell):

```
# export PATH=$PWD/rel/mynode/bin:$PATH
# mynode console|start|stop
```

The console mode will start the application and gives you access to
standard Erlang console, while start|stop action will either
start or stop the application (aka daemon mode).

Server configuration:
---------------------

The bapp is a standard OTP application [1]. You can adjust server
parameters in rel/etc/vm.args. The release parameters can be tune-up
in rel/reltool.config.

Client configuration:
---------------------

Adjust host, node name, cookie parameters in pyerl_client.py or erl_client.erl
scripts to reflect server parameters.

Code structure:
---------------

```
.
├── apps
│   └── bapp
│       ├── ebin
│       └── src
├── client
│   └── input_files
├── ebin
└── rel
    └── files
```

The apps area contains Erlang server code.
The client area contains erlang and python client code.
The rel area contains Erlang release code (generated by make).
The client/input_files is a directory which contains a list
of input files used for test purpose. Those are empty files.
The client area contains test.py file which is used as
a "test executable". It reads given input file and produce
an output file in the same area.
